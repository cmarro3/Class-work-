        <br><p class="chapter"> Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of Nature, New Scientist, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well-thumbed copy of <strong>On The Road</strong>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free. She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama DNA, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly did think she had something better to do.</p>
       
     <h2>Brined Bratwurst</h2>
        <p>This is a simple dish using fresh bratwurst, onions, and balsamic vinegar. It has a nice tangy flavor and is excellent served in crusty bread and topped with spicy mustard.</p>
        
        <ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <li>1 medium onion, cut in strips </li>
           <li> 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar </li>
            <li>5 fresh bratwurst links </li>
           <li> 1 teaspoon butter or margarine </li>
           <li> 3 1/2 cups water </li>
            </ul>
    
    <ol>  
    <h2> Method </h2>
        <li>In a large skillet, combine onion, balsamic vinegar, and water. Simmer over medium-low heat for 10 minutes. Place bratwurst in the simmering water; cover, and simmer 20 minutes. Be sure the water is only simmering, not boiling.</li>
        
        <li> Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.</li>
        
        <li>Remove the bratwurst and drain liquid from pan. Add butter to the pan with the onions and cook over low heat until onions are browned. </li>
        
        <li>Grill brats over high heat for 5 to 7 minutes, turning to brown on all sides. Serve with onions.</li>
        
        </ol>
